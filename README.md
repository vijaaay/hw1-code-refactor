## Description
This homework assignment asked to improve the codebase of a fictional marketing agency, by reworking the HTML and CSS to follow accessibility standards and to be optimized for search engines.

These are the improvements that were made:

### HTML
- Created a concise descriptive title
- Changed div element tags and introduced separate semantic html tags
- Assigned descriptive alt tag for increased accessibility
- Removed unecessary and excess tags
- Links added and they now function correctly

### CSS
- Rearranged to follow visual and logical order
- Removed unnecessary styling
- Created new classes to consolidate similar elements, and simplify the CSS, and followed the semantic structure

Both the HTML and CSS have been properly commented with the various improvements.
